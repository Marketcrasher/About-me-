      <h2>What I hope to do for a living after college</h2>
      <p>After completing my college education, I hope to work as a software developer in a FAANG company that values creativity, innovation, and social responsibility.</p>
      <p>I am particularly interested in working on projects that have the potential to make a positive impact on society, such as developing applications for healthcare, education, or even people.</p>
      <p>In addition, I also hope to continue learning and growing as a developer and contribute to open-source projects and communities!</p>
